HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGES AUGMENTATION WITH CONDITIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS

Abstract:
Deep learning approaches for histopathology image processing and analysis are gaining increasing interest in the research field, and this comes with a demand to extract more
information from images. Pathological datasets are relatively small mainly due to medical data sensitivity, confidentiality and legal issues, data complexity and labelling. Typically, a
large number of annotated images for different tissue subtypes are required as training samples to automate the learning algorithms. In this paper, we present an approach for gene-
rating synthetic images by applying a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to a dataset of histological images of human colorectal cancer and healthy tissue. We generate images
that belong to different tissue types and preserve the general structure and features of the source classes. We evaluate the quality of the generated images by conducting perceptual ex-
periments with pathologists to measure the human confusion rate as well as via the Fr ́echet Inception Distance metric.
